# Dependabot will automatically:
# 1. Check for dependency updates on the specified schedule
# 2. Create pull requests for security updates immediately
# 3. Group related updates together
# 4. Add appropriate labels and reviewers
# 5. Follow semantic versioning best practices

# Security update priority:
# - Security updates are created immediately regardless of schedule
# - Critical vulnerabilities trigger PR creation right away
# - Regular updates follow the weekly schedule

# Pull request handling:
# - Review PRs promptly to keep dependencies current
# - Run full CI/CD pipeline on all dependabot PRs
# - Merge after successful tests and security scans
# - Monitor for breaking changes in major version updates
