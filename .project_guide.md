# Git Configuration Guide

## Global Gitignore Setup

The global gitignore file is located at `~/.gitignore_global` and is configured to ignore specific files across all repositories.

```bash
# View global gitignore configuration
git config --global core.excludesfile
```

Current global ignores include:
- AGENT.md
- CLAUDE.md
- claude.local.md
- .windsurf/
- .codex/
- .claude/
- .codex
- .claude

## Global Pre-commit Hook

A global pre-commit hook is set up to prevent committing files with specific keywords or filenames.

### Hook Location
The global hooks directory is configured at `~/.git-hooks/`:

```bash
# Set global hooks path
git config --global core.hooksPath ~/.git-hooks
```

### Keyword Checking
The pre-commit hook checks for these keywords in file content:
- CLAUDE
- CODEX

### Filename Checking
The hook also prevents committing:
- Files named exactly "CLAUDE.md"
- Any file with "CODEX" in the filename

### Implementation
The pre-commit hook is implemented as a bash script that:
1. Gets all staged files
2. Checks filenames against restricted patterns
3. Scans file contents for restricted keywords
4. Blocks commits if any restrictions are found

## How to Modify

### Adding Keywords
To add more keywords to check, edit the `content_keywords` array in `~/.git-hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
content_keywords=("CLAUDE" "CODEX" "NEW_KEYWORD")
```

### Adding Filename Patterns
To add more filename patterns, add additional conditions in the file checking section:

```bash
# Example: Block files containing "AI" in filename
if [[ "$(basename "$file")" == *"AI"* ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Filename '$file' contains the restricted word 'AI'"
    found_restricted=1
fi
```
