# Recording Feature Enhancement Plan

## Current Issues Identified
1. **Recording Button**: Clicking does nothing - no actual audio recording
2. **Timer Display**: Shows random jumping numbers instead of actual recording time
3. **Waveform**: Static dummy animation instead of real audio levels
4. **History Button**: Non-functional bottom navigation

## High-Level Design

### 1. Recording Service Integration
**Goal**: Connect UI to actual AudioService for real recording

**Components**:
- AudioService integration in ConversationTab
- Real-time audio level monitoring
- Proper recording state management
- File storage and retrieval

### 2. Real-Time Audio Visualization
**Goal**: Dynamic waveform based on actual microphone input

**Components**:
- Audio level stream from AudioService
- Real-time waveform generation
- Visual feedback during recording
- Audio quality indicators

### 3. Recording Timer System
**Goal**: Accurate recording duration display

**Components**:
- Stopwatch-based timer
- Proper start/stop/pause functionality
- Duration formatting (MM:SS)
- Timer persistence during app lifecycle

### 4. History & Playback System
**Goal**: Functional history navigation and playback

**Components**:
- Recording storage management
- History screen implementation
- Playback controls
- Recording metadata (timestamp, duration, etc.)

### 5. State Management Architecture
**Goal**: Proper state flow between UI and services

**Components**:
- Provider/Riverpod state management
- Service layer integration
- Error handling and user feedback
- Permission management

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Recording Functionality
- Integrate AudioService with ConversationTab
- Implement real recording start/stop
- Add proper error handling and permissions
- Fix timer to show actual recording duration

### Phase 2: Real-Time Visualization
- Implement audio level streaming
- Create dynamic waveform component
- Add visual recording indicators
- Improve user feedback during recording

### Phase 3: History & Persistence
- Implement recording storage
- Create history screen UI
- Add playback functionality
- Implement recording management

### Phase 4: Polish & Integration
- Add transcription integration
- Implement speaker detection
- Add analysis features
- Performance optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Service Layer
```
AudioService (existing) → Real audio recording
TranscriptionService → Speech-to-text conversion
SettingsService → User preferences
```

### UI Layer
```
ConversationTab → Main recording interface
HistoryTab → Recording history management
AudioLevelBars → Real-time visualization
RecordingTimer → Accurate time display
```

### State Management
```
RecordingState → Current recording status
AudioLevelState → Real-time audio data
HistoryState → Recording list management
```

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ Recording button starts/stops actual audio recording
2. ✅ Timer shows accurate recording duration
3. ✅ Waveform responds to real microphone input
4. ✅ History button navigates to functional history screen
5. ✅ Recordings are saved and can be played back
6. ✅ Integration with transcription service
