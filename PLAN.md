   - Offline functionality with local data
   - Cache invalidation and cleanup strategies
   - Memory management and storage optimization

Data Models and Serialization:
- Freezed data classes for immutable models
- JSON serialization for API communication
- Database schemas with proper indexing
- Migration strategies for schema updates

Synchronization and Backup:
- Optional cloud storage integration (Google Drive, iCloud)
- Conflict resolution for multi-device usage
- Data export in standard formats (JSON, CSV)
- Privacy-preserving synchronization options

Performance Optimization:
- Lazy loading for large conversation histories
- Pagination for UI components
- Background data processing and cleanup
- Database query optimization and indexing

Testing and Validation:
- Repository unit tests with mock data
- Database migration testing
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Data integrity and backup validation

## Phase 3: User Interface Migration (2-3 weeks)

### Step 3.1: Core UI Components & Navigation
**Goal**: Create Flutter equivalent of SwiftUI views and tab navigation

```
Implement the main user interface structure using Flutter widgets that replicate the iOS app's five-tab navigation and core UI components.

Navigation Structure:

1. MainApp - Application root with material design:
   - MaterialApp configuration with custom theme
   - Route management and deep linking support
   - Global navigation context and state management
   - Error boundary and crash handling UI

2. MainTabView - Bottom navigation with five tabs:
   - Conversation tab (real-time transcription and interaction)
   - Analysis tab (AI insights and fact-checking results)
   - Glasses tab (Even Realities connection and status)
   - History tab (conversation history and search)
   - Settings tab (app configuration and preferences)

3. Core UI Components:
   - HelixAppBar - Custom app bar with status indicators
   - ConnectionStatusWidget - Bluetooth and service status
   - LoadingOverlay - Loading states with proper animations
   - ErrorDialog - Consistent error display and recovery
   - SettingsCard - Reusable settings UI components

Theme and Design System:
- Material Design 3 with custom color scheme
- Dark/light theme support with user preference
- Consistent typography and spacing
- Accessibility support with proper semantics
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

State Integration:
- Provider integration for all tab views
- Proper state preservation during navigation
- Loading and error states for each tab
- Deep linking support for external navigation

Testing Approach:
- Widget tests for all UI components
- Navigation testing with flutter_test
- Golden file testing for visual consistency
- Accessibility testing with semantics
```

## Implementation Prompts

### Prompt 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture
```
Create a new Flutter project for Helix cross-platform app migration. Set up the complete project structure with proper dependencies and folder organization.

Tasks:
1. Create Flutter project with proper package name and organization
2. Configure pubspec.yaml with all required dependencies:
   - flutter_blue_plus: ^1.4.4
   - flutter_sound: ^9.2.13
   - provider: ^6.1.1
   - dio: ^5.4.3+1
   - permission_handler: ^10.2.0
   - audio_session: ^0.1.16
   - speech_to_text: ^6.6.0
   - shared_preferences: ^2.2.2
   - dart_openai: ^5.1.0
   - get_it: ^7.6.4
   - freezed: ^2.4.7
   - json_annotation: ^4.8.1
   - build_runner: ^2.4.7
   - json_serializable: ^6.7.1

3. Create folder structure and initialize dependency injection
4. Set up platform permissions and basic error handling
5. Ensure all setup follows Flutter best practices

This prompt begins the foundation phase with proper project structure and dependencies for cross-platform development.
```

### Prompt 2: Core Service Interfaces & Models
```
Create the core service interfaces and data models that define the architecture for the Helix Flutter app. This establishes the foundation for all service implementations.

Tasks:
1. Create abstract service interfaces (AudioService, TranscriptionService, LLMService, GlassesService, SettingsService)
2. Define Freezed data models (ConversationModel, TranscriptionSegment, AnalysisResult, etc.)
3. Set up service locator with get_it
4. Create custom exception classes and logging infrastructure
5. Add JSON serialization code generation setup

This prompt establishes the architectural foundation with clear contracts for all services.
```
