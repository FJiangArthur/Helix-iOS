## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### **IDE Setup**

#### **VS Code (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Flutter extension
code --install-extension Dart-Code.flutter

# Recommended settings in .vscode/settings.json
{
  "dart.lineLength": 100,
  "editor.rulers": [80, 100],
  "dart.enableSdkFormatter": true
}
```

#### **Android Studio**
1. Install Flutter and Dart plugins
2. Configure Flutter SDK path
3. Enable hot reload on save

### **Common Commands**
```bash
# Development
flutter run --debug                    # Run in debug mode
flutter hot-reload                     # Hot reload changes
flutter hot-restart                    # Full restart

# Code Generation (after model changes)
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Testing
flutter test                          # Run all tests
flutter test --coverage             # Generate coverage report
flutter test test/unit/              # Run unit tests only

# Analysis
flutter analyze                      # Static code analysis
dart format .                       # Format code
flutter doctor                      # Check Flutter setup
```

### **Troubleshooting**

#### **Common Issues**

**"No API key configured"**
```bash
# Create settings.local.json with your API keys
cp settings.local.json.example settings.local.json
```

**"Build runner fails"**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

**"iOS build fails"**
```bash
cd ios && pod deintegrate && pod install && cd ..
flutter clean && flutter run -d ios
```

**"Permission denied for microphone"**
- **iOS**: Check Info.plist includes NSMicrophoneUsageDescription
- **Android**: Check AndroidManifest.xml includes RECORD_AUDIO permission
